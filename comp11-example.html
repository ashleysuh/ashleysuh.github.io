  <h2> Functions, Parameters, Recursion </h2>
  <hr>
  <p> This homework will help you learn how to write user-defined
  functions, loops and recursion in Python.  You will also build upon
  your existing knowledge of programming in Python with
  conditionals.  The skills that you will learn from this homework will
  give you a solid foundation in programming. </p>

  <h3> Start soon: This Homework Takes Time </h3>
  <p> These exercises are challenging.  Before you dive straight into
  coding, it is helpful to sit back and think about how you plan to
  write your code first.  Here are some things you could try:

    <ul> 
      <li> Understand the problems by thinking through some examples.
      <li> Using your examples, devise tests that cover as many
        different cases as possible.  Think corner cases, or edge
        cases.  (Don't forget that 0 is a number and a file can be
        empty!) </li>
      <li> Think aloud to yourself and write down some pseudocode. </li>
      <li> Run your programs and partial solutions often, understand
        error messages, fix your bugs, breath, and recurse... </li>
    </ul></p>

    <p> As always, make a <code>hw3</code> directory on the Homework
    server for this assignment.  Change into that directory, and then
    use the following command to copy over some starter files: </p>
      <blockquote><pre>
cp /comp/11/files/hw3/* ./
  </pre></blockquote>

  <hr>
  <h3> Written Section </h3>
  <hr>
  <p> A file called <code> written.text</code> containing the questions
  below have been created for you.  You should edit the file and write
  down all your answers to the written component in that file.</p>
  <h4> Written #1 </h4>
  <p> For each of the following functions, specify the possible valid
  types of the input parameter <code> x</code>, and the possible
  return types.  An input has a valid type if passing that input to the
    function will not raise a <code> TypeError</code>. </p>
  <p>
    For example, consider the following function:
    <pre>
def make_exciting(s):
    return s + "!!" </pre>
    This function has a valid input type of string (<code>str</code>),
    because a value has to be a string if you want to
    use <code>+</code> to concatenate another string
    (<code>"!!"</code>).   The return type of this function is also
    string. 
  </p>
  <p> In your answers, choose from one or more of the following
  types: </p>
  <blockquote><pre>int float string boolean None</pre></blockquote>

  <p> In Python, any value can be treated as a boolean for test.  For
  example, <code>1</code> can be treated as <code>True</code>
  and <code>0</code> can be treated as <code>False</code>.  But for
  the purpose of this exercise, pretend that is not true: a boolean
  can only be a boolean. </p>

  <ol type = "a">
  <li>
  <blockquote><pre>
def a(x):
    return x + 1 </pre></blockquote>
  <li>
    <blockquote><pre>
def b(x):
    return x + 0.1 </pre></blockquote>
  <li>
    <blockquote><pre>
def c(x):
    return x > 1 </pre></blockquote>
  <li>
    <blockquote><pre>
def d(x):
  print(x) </pre></blockquote>
  <li>
    <blockquote><pre>
def e(x):
  return x + x </pre></blockquote>
  </ol>
  <h4>Written #2</h4>

  <p>Assume the following functions have been defined in a session of
  Python3. </p>

  <blockquote><pre>
def foo(a, b, c):
    if a:
        return b + c
    return b - c

def bar(x, y):
    return foo(x < y, x, y) </pre></blockquote>

  <p>What is the type and value of the following expressions? </p>

  <ol type = "a">
  <li> <code> foo(True, 1, 2) </code>
  <li> <code> bar(10, 5) </code>
  <li> <code> bar(foo(1 > 2, 1, 2), 3) </code>
  </ol>

  <h4> Written #3 </h4>

  <p>Assume the following function has been defined in a session of
  Python3. </p>

  <blockquote><pre>
def fun(x, y, z):
    if x < y:
        y -= x
    else:
        y = x - y
    
    if y > x:    
        print("shark meldon")
    elif z > x and z > y:
        print("mark sheldon")
    elif z > y:
        print("tufts university")
    else:
        print("comp11") </pre></blockquote>
  <p> Give, if possible, a combination
  of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>z</code> that will allow
  the program to print each of the following strings. If the string
  cannot be produced by the above function, then say so, and explain
  why. </p>

  <ol type = "a">
    <li> <code> shark meldon </code> 
    <li> <code> mark sheldon </code>
    <li> <code> tufts university </code>
    <li> <code> comp11 </code>
  </ol>

  <h4> Written #4 </h4>

  <p> Before you start working on each of the three programming
  exercises below, devise and write down at least three test cases for
  each.  You should state clearly what the inputs are, and what the
  printed result should look like.  Describe, if you can, what each of
  the test cases test for. </p>

  <p> Your tests should be different from the examples given below. </p>

  <p> Making tests before you begin coding is a very useful
  programming practice.  Your tests will help you understand the
  problem and uncover bugs when you test your program. </p>

  <h3> Programming Section </h3>
  <hr>
  <p> <b> IMPORTANT: Do Not Use Global Variables </b> In all of your code for this course, we forbid the use of global variables (variables defined outside of any function or under <code> if __name__ == '__main__':</code>). We have used, and we'll continue to use, global <i> constants</i>. Learn how to use parameters.</p> 

  <p> <b> IMPORTANT: Output Format Matters. </b> These problems will
  specify the format of the input data and also the format your
  program <i> must </i> use when reporting results. You will <i> lose
  many points </i> if your program does not report results in the <i>
  exact format </i> specified by the problems. </p>

  <p><b> IMPORTANT: Comments and Indenting. </b> Your code must be
  readable. There are three parts to writing readable code: comments,
  indenting, and functions.  You must include comments at the top of
  your program and before each function. The comments at the top of
  your program must include your name, date, title, and brief
  description.  The comments for each function must include the
  purpose, the meaning of the parameters, and any value returned. Some
  of the code from labs are good examples.  Your code must be indented
  using four spaces for each level of indentation. </p>
  <p> Finally, as youâ€™ve seen already, breaking a big program into
  smaller, named actions (functions, abbreviations) makes the program
  easier to manage and easier to read. Use small functions (under 20
  lines each, way under is better). </p>

  <p> To help you get started, we have provided you a template for the
  following programming exercises called <code>
  template.py </code>. </p>


  <h4> Programming #1: <code> feet.py </code></h4>

  <p> The first programming exercise is to help you get comfortable
  with writing functions in Python. Write a program
  named <code>feet.py</code> that reads in a length in feet and
  inches, and outputs the equivalent lengths in meters and
  centimeters. Your program must ask the user for the number of feet
  and inches, and output the correct length in meters and centimeters
  using the format shown here (the bolded items are typed by the
  user): </p>
    <blockquote><code>
    Feet? <b> 12 </b> <br>
    Inches? <b> 7</b> <br>
    3 meters, 84 centimeters
    </code></blockquote>
  <p> This example is indented for typesetting purposes. You should
  print every line at the beginning of each line. There is a single
  endline at the end of the last line. </p>
  <p>Your program should repeat the computation until the user chooses
  to stop. After you finish every conversion, print the following
  message and read in a single character, <b> Y </b> or <b> N</b>, as
  follows: </p>
    <blockquote><code> Continue(Y/N)? <b> Y</b> </code> </blockquote>
  <p> In the case of a <b> Y </b>, ask the user again for feet and
  inches and repeat the conversion. Otherwise, you should terminate
  the program. </p>

  <p> If a user provides you a negative number for either the number
  of feet or number of inches, print a error message to the terminal
  after both numbers have been received:</p>
  <blockquote><pre>Error: input should be nonnegative.</pre></blockquote> 
  <p> Here's a full example: </p>

  <blockquote><code>
    Feet? <b> 100 </b> <br>
    Inches? <b> 2 </b> <br>
    30 meters, 53 centimeters <br>
    Continue(Y/N)? <b> Y</b> <br>
    Feet? <b> 5 </b> <br>
    Inches? <b> 1 </b> <br>
    1 meter, 55 centimeters <br>
    Continue(Y/N)? <b> Y</b> <br>
    Feet? <b> 0 </b> <br>
    Inches? <b> 0 </b> <br>
    0 meters, 0 centimeters <br>
    Continue(Y/N)? <b> Y</b> <br>
    Feet? <b> -1 </b> <br>
    Inches? <b> 0 </b> <br>
    Error: input should be nonnegative. <br>
    Continue(Y/N)? <b> N</b> <br>
    </code></blockquote>

  <p> <b> Requirements</b> 
    <ul>
      <li> You must write <code> if __name__ == '__main__': </code> at
      the bottom of your code, and it should serve no other purpose
      than calling a function called <code> main() </code> with no
      parameters. </li>
      <li> <code> main()</code> contains a <code> while </code>
      loop. In every iteration of the loop, it reads in the two
      integers from the user then calls a function
      called <code>print_meters_centimeters()</code> that accepts the
      two integers as parameters. After the call
      to <code>print_meters_centimeters()</code> is complete, it
      should ask the user whether or not to continue.</li>
      <li><code>print_meters_centimeters()</code> prints the
      equivalent length in meters and centimeters according to the
      format specified above. </li>
      <li> <b> DO </b> worry about singular forms of the words
      'meters' and 'centimeters'. </li>
      <li> Your output should match <i> exactly </i> with the example
      given above, including the error messages. </li>
      <li> When printing the number of meters and centimeters, round to the <i> nearest integer</i>, which may require rounding up or down. </li>
      <li> Under no circumstances may you put the entire program under <code> main() </code> or <code> if __name__ == '__main__': </code>. </li>
    </ul>
  </p> 
  <p> A program written without the use of
  the <code>print_meters_centimeters() </code> function will earn no
  credit.</p>
  <p> There are 0.3048 meters in a foot, 100 centimeters in a meter,
  and 12 inches in a foot. </p>
  <p> Before you begin, think through all of these functions. Each
  should have a single, repeatable job. Make sure you consider what
  the names, parameters, and return types of each one should be. </p>
  </pre></blockquote>

  <p> <b> How to get started </b> </p>
  <ol> 
    <li> <b> Make Test Data: </b> Devise at least 3 different test
    cases before you start coding and document them in <code>
    written.text</code>. You should use these test cases to test your
    program.</li>
    <li> <b> Write the Code: </b> To use the template we've provided
    you, use the command:
  <blockquote><code>cp template.py feet.py</code> </blockquote> 
  Then edit <code> feet.py </code> with the editor of your choice.  </li>
    <li> <b> Test, Fix, ...: </b> Do not write everything at once. Start small, run often, and fix your code:
      <blockquote><code>python3 feet.py</code> </blockquote></li>
  </ol>


  <h4> Programming #2: <code>pattern.py </code> </h4>
  <p> You've seen in lab how to print inches of snow recursively in
  Python. Similarly, in this exercise, you will draw shapes based on
  user input. For example,
  <blockquote><pre>
XXXXX
XXX--
X----
XXX--
XXXXX
  </pre></blockquote>
  Or, for even numbers:
    <blockquote><pre>
XXXXXX
XXXX--
XX----
------
XX----
XXXX--
XXXXXX
  </pre></blockquote></p>
  <p> Write a program called <code> pattern</code> that reads in two
  strings and the integer width of the pattern.  The program prints a
  picture as shown with the two strings.  In the first example above,
  the two strings are "X" and "-" , and the width is 5.  In the second
  example, the strings are the same, but the width is 6. </p>

  <p> The program must ask the user for input using the following format:</p>
  <blockquote><code>
    First string? <b> X</b><br>
    Second string? <b> - </b><br>
    Width? <b> 5 </b>
    </code> </blockquote>

  <p> <b> Requirements</b> 
    <ul> <li> You must write at least two functions: <code>
    main() </code> and <code> draw_pattern()</code>. You may, if you
    wish, use other functions to draw each row or each part of each
    row. Observe that there are no spaces between characters in a
    line. There is a single new line after the end of each line,
    including the last line. </li>
    <li> If the program is given nonpositive or floating point input,
    it should exit without printing anything </li>
    <li> For this assignment, you <b> must use recursion </b>. A
    program not using recursion will earn no credit. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p> <b> A program not using recursion will earn no credit. <br>
          A program not using recursion will earn no credit. <br>
          A program not using recursion will earn no credit. <br> </b></p>

  <!-- <p> <b> Printing in Python </b> </p> -->
  <p> You may find yourself needing to use the Python <code>
  print() </code> function without adding a newline at the end of your
  sentence. You can do this by adding an optional <em>keyword
  parameter</em> <code> end = ""</code> to the function: </p>
  <blockquote><pre> 
print("Hello, ", end = "")
print("world.")
</pre></blockquote>
    <p> The <code> print() </code> function, like many other functions
    in Python, accepts optional paramters such as <code>
    end</code>. These parameters have default values, which for <code>
    end </code> is a newline character, but may be changed to suit
      your purposes. </p>
    <p>Try typing the above examples into a Python 3 shell to make
    sure you understand what the <code>end</code> keyword paramter
    to <code>print</code> does.</p>


  <p> As before, you should write the test cases first. You may use the template to get started by running: </p>
  <blockquote><code>cp template.py pattern.py</code> </blockquote>

  <h4> Programming #3: <code> reverse.py </code></h4>
  <p> Write a program called <code> reverse </code> that reads a file
  in and writes a new file. The new file should be the same as the
  file read in, but with every line reversed. For example, if this is
  the file provided by the user:</p>
  <blockquote> <pre>
this is a line
Another line
comp11 is fun!
y
a
y
</pre></blockquote>
  <p> Then this should be the file written by the program: </p>

  <blockquote> <pre>
enil a si siht
enil rehtonA
!nuf si 11pmoc
y
a
y
  </pre></blockquote>
  <p> Your program should start off by asking the user for the name of
  the file using the following prompt: </p>
  <blockquote><code>Enter a filename: <b>testfile</b> </code></blockquote>

  <p>The user repsonse is in <b>bold</b> again.</p>
  <p> Once you are done reversing the file, write a file that is
  named <code> reversed_</code> plus the name of the original
  file. For example, if the file provided by the user is called <code>
  testfile</code>, then you should write a file to the same directory
  called <code> reversed_testfile</code>. </p>



  <p> <b> Requirements</b> 
    <ul> <li> Use <i> functions, functions, </i>and<i>
    functions</i>. Break this large problem into smaller subproblems,
    each of which is accomplished by a different function. To help you
    design a solution, you must have at least one function
    dedicated to reversing a string. </li>
    <li> The function that reverses a string <b> must use
    recursion </b>.  A program that does not use recursion will be <b>
    heavily penalized</b>. </li>
    <li> For the rest of your program, you may use loops or recursions
    at your discretion. </li>
    <li> You do not have to worry about a file that does not exist or
    is corrupted. </li>
    <li> Every line in a file ends with an 'invisible' endline
    character.  A naive solution will reverse the line so that the
    endline character is moved to the beginning of the line. This is
    not the behavior we want.  Make sure that the endline character is
    still at the end of the line, rather than at the beginning. <i>
    This might be tricky</i>. </li>
    <li> You should <i> write </i> the reversed lines to a file. <b>
        DO NOT </b> print to terminal. </li>
    <li> DO NOT use built-in facilities for reversing sequences.
    Write it yourself.
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p> Don't rush into coding &mdash; think carefully before you begin. Your
  test cases for this exercise should be text files that you
  created.  Copy the contents of these text files to the written
  portion of this homework to earn credit for written #4. </p>

  <p> To successfully complete this exercise, you will need to
  understand basic file I/O and string manipulation.  See below.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember that a file is nothing more than a very long
  chunk of string, and a string is nothing more than a sequence of
  chars. You might find it helpful to use the built-in
  function <code>len()</code> and <code>strip()</code> on strings, and
  use string indexing to get each individual character.</p>
  <blockquote><pre>
aString = "Hello, world."
print(aString[4])  # Prints 'o' 
print(aString[-1]) # Prints the last char of the string, which is 'd'
  </blockquote>

  <p> Among the files you've copied is an example program <code>
  read_and_print.py </code> that illustrates basic file reading in
  Python. You should also refer to the official documention of Python3
  on file I/O, which can be
  found <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">here</a>. The
  required textbook, <i> Think Python </i> by Allen Downey, has a easy
  introduction to Python file IO in section 14.2. </p>

  <h4> Submitting Your Work </h4>

  <p> When you are ready to submit, turn them in by typing: </p>
