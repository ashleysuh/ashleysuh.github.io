    <p> I took this photo after biking around Colorado all day! While I was an undergraduate studying computer science, 
      I was selected as a SULI intern at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado. 
      I spent the summer coding a project that simulated the North American power grid system, in order to figure out 
      the best way to conserve energy over time. I hope to return back to NREL one day, it has a beautiful campus, and Colorado is so cool!</p>
